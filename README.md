Summary:
--------
I was on a mission to build a remote for my house, after a bunch of research I found the [XP Pen ACK05 Wireless Shortcut Remote](https://www.amazon.com/ACK05-Wireless-Bluetooth-Programmable-Customized/dp/B0BVW3S1QR), it is very cool!

I'm already using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and some other stuff, but I couldn't figure out how to connect the remote. So here we are ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

-------------
  
```
pip install xp-pen
```

There are 5 *methods* and event can have:
