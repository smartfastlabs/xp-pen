Summary:
--------
I was on a mission to build a remote for my house, after a bunch of research I found the [XP Pen ACK05 Wireless Shortcut Remote](https://www.amazon.com/ACK05-Wireless-Bluetooth-Programmable-Customized/dp/B0BVW3S1QR).  It is  wireless, usb, decent range, awesome battery life, scroll wheel, small; all around awesome!

I'm already using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and some other creative stuff; how hard could it be ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  This allowed me to map remote key presses to Home Assistant API calls, but you can use it to run arbitrary python code.


Installation:
-------------
  
```
pip install xp-pen
```

Usage:
--------------

**YOU MUST USE THE USB "DONGLE", BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK**

See [examples](https://github.com/smartfastlabs/xp-pen/tree/main/examples).

There are 5 *methods* an event can have:

- down
- up
- scroll
- double-down (Click within .5 seconds of the previous)
- long-down (Down for more than 1 second)

Every event has a value, this corresponds to the button pressed; see image above.
